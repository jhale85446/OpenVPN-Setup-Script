# OpenVPN-Setup-Script
Bash Script Project to Setup OpenVPN on various Distros

## This project just started. The first script is in development.

## Debian
The Debian script is based on instructions provided by [Alvin Wan at Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-openvpn-server-on-debian-8)

I have had good luck with implementing OpenVPN in the Kali Rolling Distro both on VM's and Kali on Raspberry Pi.
Kali includes a lot of security tools that won't be needed for normal users just wanting a VPN. However, Offensive Security does a good job maintaining the security, updates, and base system that make this distro very useful for OpenVPN. 

## Future Plans
I plan to have a script for Ubuntu as well. Maybe one for CentOS.
